# FSM-Based Digital Control for 40Ã—32 ROIC Using Verilog with Buffered Timing Logic

This project implements a Verilog-based digital controller for a **40Ã—32 Readout Integrated Circuit (ROIC)** using a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** and **shift-register-based column and row scanning**. The design emulates the behavior of a larger 640Ã—512 ROIC architecture but is scaled down to 40Ã—32 for simulation and waveform verification.

The digital controller systematically enables each pixel in a row-column matrix using precise timing control and sequential logic. A **buffered logic scheme** is integrated to mimic the real-time constraints typically encountered in infrared imaging systems.

## ðŸ§  Buffered Timing Logic (Explained)

Unlike simple scan controllers that activate columns immediately, this implementation introduces **timing buffers** before and after each row and column operation:

- **Column Activation**:
  - 4 clock cycles **delay before** activating `col[0]`
  - 40 columns are **sequentially enabled**, one per clock
  - 4 clock cycles **delay after** the last column is scanned

- **Row Activation**:
  - Each row is held active (`row_enable[x] = 1`) for the full 48 clock cycles (4 + 40 + 4)
  - A 4-clock **gap (LOW)** is introduced between row transitions

This buffered logic helps ensure clean synchronization between column scanning and analog signal acquisition (simulated behavior of ROIC â†’ ADC interface).
